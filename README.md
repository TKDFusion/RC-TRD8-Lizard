Lizard is a 3D printed RC race car for onroad usage. The full description of this project is available on Instructables: https://www.instructables.com/Lizard-3D-Printed-RC-Race-Car/

Here, you can find the Gerber files for the PCBs and the sketches required for the ESP32 microcontroller in the remote control and in the car. Also, you can find the codes required to operate a separate data logger alongside the car, including MATLAB functions to evaluate the recorded data graphically. Further, all files for printing are provided as .stl and .stp files.

Also, I added the BOM as an Excel file, and you can find .stp files of the different part groups as well as of the full car assembly, as an aid in assembling the car.
