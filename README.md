Lizard is a 3D printed RC race car for onroad usage. The full description of this project is available on Instructables: https://www.instructables.com/Lizard-3D-Printed-RC-Race-Car/

Here, you can find the Gerber files for the PCBs and the sketches required for the ESP32 microcontroller in the remote control and in the car. Also, you can find the codes required to operate a separate data logger alongside the car, including MATLAB functions to evaluate the recorded data graphically. Further, all files for printing are provided as .stl and .stp files.
